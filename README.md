# Assembly_8086
Explored the basics of programming in assembly 8086 language. I got to learn a lot about registers, how data moves in and out of these registers and how to use these concepts in code!

# Overview
This repository contains codes in assembly 8086 for array addition, array sorting, BCD to HEX conversion, Several Register Info displaying, Copying contents from one file to another and String operations

# Setup
*For linux*
- Use of any text editor for typing the code, save the file with .asm extension
- Use an assembler (nasm) and a linker (ld) in the terminal to execute the code
- You can use the following commands
  - nasm -f elf my_program.asm
  - ld -o my_program my_program.o
  - ./my_program


*For windows*
- You can use emulators like DOSBox but i would recommend using any x86 online compiler. Personally i prefer to use 'mycompiler.io'
